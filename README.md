# System of linear equations (Fixed-point iteration method)

The system must follow the requirements:
1. System must provide 3 ways of input: from file, from console and random filling.
2. System must provide a dominating diagonal check. If failed, system must try rearranging rows to get a dominating diagonal.
3. System must provide the user with possibility of choosing accuracy.
4. System must inform about count of iterations have made to get the result.

Program must validate data and inform the user about errors.
